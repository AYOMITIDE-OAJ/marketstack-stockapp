   1. Data Layer: This layer handles data sources, repositories, and data models
   2. Domain Layer: The domain layer defines the business logic and use cases of the app
   3. Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for UI, user interactions, and displaying data to users. It includes widgets, views, and view models (or view states) which are responsible for managing UI-related logic.
   4. Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer contains code related to third-party api service.
